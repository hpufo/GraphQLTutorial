# GraphQLTutorial
This is a full-stack project I've completed to learn GraphQL and Apollo.

# Backend
A GraphQL server using Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose

# Frontend
React with Apollo 

# Prereqs before you run
First you need to have MongoDB installed, or have could access to an instance. The connetion string is located in backend/server.js if you need to change it. 

Then do an npm install in the frontend folder and backend folder.

# How to run

For the backend run "node server.js" in the backend folder.

For the frontend run "npm start" in the frontend folder.

# Use
 There is no way of adding authors through the frontend. You will have to add them first using graphiql at http://localhost:4000/graphql
